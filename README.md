# anime-invaders

# Anime Invaders is a fun, addictive one-player space-invaders spinoff that allows the user to control the main character 
# of the origin story (Naruto) and shoot shurikens up towards a hoard of his peer Hinata. As the wave of aliens (Hinata)
# are destroyed, their horizontal and vertical speed increase at a steady factor, prompting the player (Naruto) to 
# crank up his activity! By utilizing the Pygame extension, implementing scores, images for the characters, and
# even setting the scene with a user-friendly background, the game is simple and easy to play. The difficulty of
# the game increases as the user wins each level and their point value increases with each alien killed 
# and with each level completed!
